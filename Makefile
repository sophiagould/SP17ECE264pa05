# You need to write this file so that
#
# "make" will create an executable called pa05
# 
# "make test" will run the three input files 
# 
# input: inputs/testinput1; output: id1, first1, last1
# input: inputs/testinput2; output: id2, first2, last2
# input: inputs/testinput3; output: id3, first3, last3
# 
# compare your program's output with the expected ouputs by
# using the "diff" command in Linux
#
# "make memory" calls valgrind to check memory errors
#
# "make clean" remove .o and all output files
